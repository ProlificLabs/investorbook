# InvestorBook

Welcome to InvestorBook, Inc! This is your first week at InvestorBook and you
are excited to ship a new version of the app.

# Your Task

You met with the CEO and promised to deliver a clean, fast and beautiful UI for working with
the data -- in roughly four hours! 

After brainstorming with the design team, you agree to build the JSX components and the css for this [design](https://www.figma.com/file/JJt9uopcl9K3WxPjCxT8V0/Investorbook?node-id=0%3A1).

## Basic version

For the basic version, you agree to build the React components and css to match the design. The modals and interactions should be functional and intuitive to use. Feel free to use fake/mock data. 

## Advanced Version

If you have additional time, use your own discretion to decide which features to build. Here's a few ideas:

 - Enhance the design with great animations, tooltips, or however you want to make the app more intuitive to use
 - Make it responsive for small and wider screens
 - Improve the tables with resizing columns, filtering or sorting functionalities
 - Add an offline mode allowing users to add, update and delete data.
 - Impress us with your ideas :) 

# Evaluation Criteria

You will be evaluated on:

1. Attention to detail and closeness to the design
2. Code quality & project structure
2. Intuitive UX

Once you are done, please write down or record a short video going over:
 - What is finished versus what is still a WIP
 - If you had another week to work on this project, what would you add or change
 - What would it take to be production ready and ship to customers

# Getting Started
