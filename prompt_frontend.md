# InvestorBook

Welcome to InvestorBook, Inc! This is your first week at InvestorBook and you
are excited to tackle one of the biggest challenge of the company.

# Your Task

You met with the CEO and understood that the company will go down unless you can write a spreadsheet-like component that can work with millions of rows. You see, since the launch last summer, the number of users have been growing exponentially and the previous spreadsheet component just can't handle it anymore. You agreed to jump on this critical project and build a working version in about 4 hours.

## Basic version

For the "v1" of this spreadsheet-like component, make it so that you can load millions of rows in memory while only showing a dozen or so rows on the screen. Scrolling through them should be super fast with a great user experience. Your spreadsheet should have a few columns and the cells don't need to be editable.

## Advanced version

If you have additional time, use your own discretion to decide which additional features to build. Here's a few ideas:

- Resizable columns
- Editable cells
- Sorting and filtering mechanisms
- Dynamic cells as React components
- Lazy loading (As the user scrolls, new data is fetched asynchronously)
- Impress us with your ideas :)
